This project is an AI-powered image generation application built with React that leverages OpenAI's image generation API. Users can describe what they want to see, and the AI generates images based on those descriptions.

## Overview

The AI Image Generator application is a simple yet powerful tool that allows users to input text prompts, triggering the image generation process through OpenAI's API. The generated images provide a visual representation of the user's input, showcasing the capabilities of AI in creative image generation.

## Features

- **Image Generation:** Users can input textual descriptions or prompts for the AI to create corresponding images.
- **Real-time Loading:** Users can track the loading progress of the generated image.
- **Fallback Image:** Displays a default image while the AI-generated image is loading.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be accessible across various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** Frontend development and user interaction.
- **OpenAI API:** Integration for image generation.
- **HTML/CSS:** Styling and structuring the application components.

## Usage

To use this application locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up your OpenAI API key and replace the `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY` variable in the code with your actual API key.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Run the application locally using `npm start`.
5. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Future Improvements
